# Case_Study_2
The Second Case Study for Doing Data Science!

For this Case Study I am looking at attrition of employees for a business. In this dataset there are around 40 variables and contain various data points that a business may have on their employees

I have created an EDA full of correlations and some cool graphs.

I have also predicted Attrition through different model buildings and measured my results.

Please read through my analysis, use my code, and watch my video!
